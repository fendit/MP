<h2> Anna - A prototype AI with Google tts recognition for Mac <h2>

Here I show the python script for Anna (the AI I built with *Google Text-To-Speech Recognition*)
Most of the lines in Anna are copied from various sources, but they are for Windows. I have modified in a simple and direct way on Mac.

Here are some sources for references:
* https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU_ppVsyJu8 (A very good, detailed video for using alternative tts recognition)
* https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5mu6qlFY3x0&t=264s (Another great example for creating AI)
* https://pythonspot.com/personal-assistant-jarvis-in-python/ (A great starting point if you are using Windows)

Here are some conditions before using the py script:
1. It is only for Mac users
1. Make sure your mac connects to the Internet
1. Input your name and your birthday after executing the script (You can set user's name and birthday by default, which are "user" and "birthday" respectively
1. Change the language if you want (please have a look at this: https://github.com/pndurette/gTTS/issues/31)

Functions I have added:
1. "How are you"
    1. Anna can respond to "how are you" question. She will ask the user the same question and wait for user's reply.
1. "What time is it"
    1. Anna can provide the current date and time.
1. "Open (Application)"
    1. Anna can open applications installed on your Mac.
1. "Play music"
    1. Anna can play music for you (by default I added a few songs with links directly linked to YouTube)
1. "Goodbye, Adios, Ciao"
    1. This can exit the programme.

There are other hidden features as well
1. "Happy Birthday"
2. "Happy Cinco de Mayo"
3. "Random weekday quotes"
