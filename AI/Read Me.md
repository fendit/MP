Here I show the python script for Anna (the AI I built with *Google Text-To-Speech Recognition*)
Most of the lines in Anna are copied from various sources, but they are for Windows. I have modified in a simple and direct way on Mac.

Here are some sources for references:

* https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5mu6qlFY3x0&t=264s
* https://pythonspot.com/personal-assistant-jarvis-in-python/ (A great starting point if you are using Windows)

Here are some conditions before using the py script:
1. It is only for Mac users
1. Make sure your mac connects to the Internet
