# Range Frequency Theory (RFT)
This is from one of the assignments I worked before. However, this has been modified with Shiny. 

### Features
1. Select one of the price distributions (unimodal, bimodal, positively or negatively skewed).
1. Set up weighting parameter via the slider (ranging from 0 to 1)

### Outputs
1. Table
1. RFT values (RFT)
1. RFT prediction (RFTP)
