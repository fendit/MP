# Here is another MP about Range Frequency Theory (RFT)
# This is from one of the assignments I worked before

# However, this has been modified with Shiny
# Users can select one of the price distributions (unimodal, bimodal, positively or negatively skewed)
# weighting parameter can be set up via the slider (ranging from 0 to 1)
# But why not trying to click the triangle button and see what would happen? :D

# There are three outputs, table, RFT values (RFT) and RFT prediction (RFTP)
